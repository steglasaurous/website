I like to build stuff that is useful both to me and to the community.  Here's the list!

# Streamer Tools

## Requestobot

![](/assets/images/requestobot-logo-150.png){: .align-right}

A Twitch song request chatbot which manages song requests for streamers playing games that don't have their own 
built-in request system. It has an up-to-date database of song details for OSTs and custom songs for each supported 
game.

## Universal Song Overlay

A browser overlay for OBS that works with a number of VR rhythm games, showing information on the song being played, 
album art, song progress, score and player health (where supported).

## StegChat

Other overlays didn't quite do what I wanted, so I made one. :)

This is an OBS browser chat overlay that:

* supports the usual twitch emotes and
* shows messages from one or more twitch channels
* has theme selections

## Audica Websocket Server

A mod to add a websocket server to Audica that emits song and score information.  Useful to overlays like the Universal
Song Overlay, Streamer.bot and others.

## Twitch Connector Mod for Audica

A mod that allows two-way communication to Twitch chat for other mods (like the SongRequest mod)
